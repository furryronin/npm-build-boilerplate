# npm-build-boilerplate


## Disclaimer
Do you think Gulp has killed Grunt. Definetly no, npm has killed both of them.
This boilerplate is all about using npm as build commands.

Have you find it helpful, show your interest by clicking :star:.

I have written an article called **[npm as build tool]()**. You can view it for further understanding, but not now the article is submitted for review.
